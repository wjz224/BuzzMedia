This folder (thebuzz) functions as the newly updated, React implemented web folder. 

To run the server in dev mode, run "npm start"

or run "npm run build" to start the server in build mode.

Run "npm test" to run the implemented react tests. Tests only run for the files changed since last commit.

This front end actively interacts with the backend, and recieves/send data to the heroku app.
